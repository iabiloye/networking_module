# Overview

 This program demonstrates a basic networking concept using Python sockets. It simulates how two devices (a server and a client) communicate using IP addresses and ports.
The server listens for a connection request, while the client connects and sends a greeting message.
The goal of this program is to strengthen my understanding of how data travels across a network, how sockets work, and how client-server interactions occur in real time.

    It creates a simple client-server connection on the same computer (localhost).

    The server listens for connections, and the client sends a message ("Hello, Server!").

    This helps illustrate how devices communicate using IP addresses and ports.

# Development Environment

This project was developed using Python 3 within the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor.
The environment was configured to support Python programming and Git version control for efficient code management.

The setup allows smooth execution of the networking program and easy tracking of changes through Git. This environment also helps maintain consistency as I build and test more advanced networking projects throughout the module.
